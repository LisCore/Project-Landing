# Project-Landing

## Description
This is a personal project to test my CSS and HTML skills. Also to practice using flexboxs.

## Index.html
In this file, it holds all the necessary images, paragraphs and buttons/links necessary to hit the requirements given from the Odin Project. 

## Style.css
This file contains all the manipulation of elements needed to match similarily to what was given on the desired photo given by the Odin Project


### How this project went:
The html part got done pretty quickly, just copying what was seen on the photo given to me. 

For the CSS part, it took some time to understand things not taught in the course. Things like how to make the hero fixed at the top and. 
The most difficult part of the project was in the *Some Random Information* section. Initially, my thought process was to save everything in one div. This meant that the photo and the paragraph elements were grouped together in one box. To make it follow the format of the photo shown to us, I had to create 2 divs, one to hold the img and paragraph, and the other strictly for holding the img. 
Another part I ran into that was difficult was the contain-top class. Trying to mimic the different sections and making the padding/margins look similar to what was given meant alot of playing around in CSS.
